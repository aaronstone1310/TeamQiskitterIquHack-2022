Three collinear point check
In this project, our team has designed a game. In this game we generate two coordinate points randomly with a quantum circuit and Hadamard gates. Each coordinate contains x and y, each of which we produce with two qubits, for a total of 8 qubits. So in fact each of the values ​​of x and y can be 00 or 01 or 10 or 11 (0, 1, 2 and 3) so each of the points can be one of 16 possible states. Then in another circuit we give these two coordinates (8 qubits) to the circuit as a velocity. (Preparation is done with gates I and X). Then, by applying Hadamard gates on all qubits, we put them in superposition mode. In the next part, the player can select gates of his choice (from Pauli gates) and add them to the qubits. (Up to three gates per qubit) and must do this so that it can produce an output coordinate so that all three points are on the same line. Then, using a program on a classic computer, we check the output and tell the player whether the three points are on the same line or not.
